Tested: Working Video 720p, 1080p & Sound

The Framebuffer (MISTER_FB) is disabled on purpose in this core, which means that screen rotation is not going to work.

This is temporary until we identify what is causing several color issues.

# Tecmo

Tecmo was a Japanese video game company founded in 1967, who like many other game companies of the era, had their roots outside the amusement business. In Tecmo's case, they were originally a supplier of cleaning equipment.

Nevertheless, they went on to create some classic arcade games during the 80s and 90s. Many of which saw later releases on consoles like Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System, Commodore 64, Atari Lynx, etc.

This core currently supports three games: Rygar (1986), Gemini Wing (1987), and Silkworm (1988).

## Getting Started

Place the MRA, RBF, and the MAME ROM files in the following locations:

```
_Arcade/Rygar.mra
_Arcade/Gemini Wing.mra
_Arcade/Silkworm.mra
_Arcade/cores/tecmo.rbf
_Arcade/mame/rygar.zip
_Arcade/mame/gemini.zip
_Arcade/mame/silkworm.zip
```

For more information on using MRA files with MiSTer, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki/Arcade-Roms).
